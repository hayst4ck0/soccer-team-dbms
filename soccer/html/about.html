Soccer Management System maintains a database of all the soccer players who are associated with a particular team. This has been developed to overcome the problems prevailing in the practising manual system. Managing the ever-increasing numbers of players and teams in different parts of the world is a huge task. Thus, there is a need for a system that can handle the data of such a large number of soccer players. This project aims to simplify the task of maintaining records because of its user-friendly nature. HTML along with CSS is used at the front end and the WAMP server is used at the back end, the connectivity is done through PHP. The project proceeds through a sequence of well-designed forms provided with validations to ensure consistency, reliability and most importantly correctness of information fed into the database.
The Web-based GUI application also allows users to track complete details about a team starting from the players in the team, the coach of the team, the matches it has played, and this all along with the stats of the players. In conclusion, this application will come extremely handy in maintaining player spread across different teams and nations. This project aims at error-free, secure, reliable and fast management system. <br>It assists the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than concentrate on the record keeping. The project describes how to manage good performance and better services.
